There are however a number of assumptions that need to be made about this data. 
First is to negate the possibility that the time awake in bed before falling asleep 
could be attributed to activities one may endeavour in performing such as reading,
sexual intercourse etcâ€¦ The assumption is therefore that the participant struggles to fall asleep.*/
